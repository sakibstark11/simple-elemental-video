# Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
-   [Aws Cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli)
-   Make

# Login to Your Aws Account

You can set the environment variables manually or

```sh
eval "$(aws configure export-credentials --profile your-profile-name --format env)"
```

Export a region

```sh
export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
```

# Run Everything at Once

> For security, we whitelist your public ip on mediaconnect, which means if you have a carrier NAT, you might not be able to push video, in that case, change [this](./main.tf#20) to `0.0.0.0/0`.

> Make sure you change [this](./main.tf#16) to something that makes sense to you as it will be used to prefix resources.

Run the following command from the terminal

```sh
make deploy
```

This should print a playback url

# Playback

You can use [hls.js](https://hlsjs.video-dev.org/demo) to playback your video
or run the following command to get a prepared url

```sh
make print-hls-playback-url
```

# Destroy Everything

Run the following command from the terminal

```sh
make destroy
```
